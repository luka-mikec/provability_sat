# provability_sat
Satisfiability verifiers for certain modal logics concerned with provability.

[Live version](https://luka.doublebuffer.net/o/il)

Use [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) to compile. Currently requires devel branch of Nim (1.0.3+).

At the moment this contains satisfiability verifiers for the following logics: 
 * provability logic (GL) (similar to [trees](https://github.com/luka-mikec/godellob-prover));
 * basic interpretability logic (IL) (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05599);
 * interpretability logic ILW;
 * interpretability logic ILP;
 * interpretability logic ILM.
